# ❤️ Heart Disease Detection Project

A comprehensive system to detect the likelihood of heart disease using:
- 🧠 Rule-Based Expert System
- 🌳 Machine Learning (Decision Tree Classifier)
- 🎨 Streamlit Interface for User Interaction

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Preprocess and analyze heart disease data
- Build a rule-based expert system for interpretability
- Train a Decision Tree model for automatic prediction
- Compare the performance of both systems
- Provide an intuitive UI for users to test the model

---


---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Streamlit
- Rule-Based Logic (custom logic)

---

## 🧠 Expert System Logic

- Custom rules based on medical knowledge
- Inputs: Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
- Outputs: Risk levels (Low, Medium, High)

---

## 🔍 ML Model - Decision Tree

- Preprocessed features
- 80/20 train-test split
- Tuned with GridSearchCV
- Saved model using `joblib`

---

## 💻 Streamlit App

Launch the app locally:
```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Heart_Disease_Detection.git
cd Heart_Disease_Detection

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run ui/app.py
